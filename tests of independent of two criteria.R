#Tests of Independence
#Daniel and Cross pp 619ff

#The chi-square test of independence can be used to test the NULL hypothesis
#that two criteria of classification, applied to the same set of entities, are
#independent. - that is, the distribution of one criterion is the same no matter
#what the distribution of the other criterion.

#The NULL hypothesis is always that the two criteria of classification are independent.
#If the NULL is rejected, we conclude that the two criteria are NOT independent.

#Example: if socioeconomic status and area of residence of inhabitants in a city
#         are independent, we expect to find the same proportion of families in the
#         low, medium, and high socioeconomic groups in all areas of the city

#Typically involves a contingency table with counts/frequencies

#Given the observed counts from a sample, compute what the expected counts would
#be if the NULL hypothesis is true and the two criteria are independent.
#If the two are independent, the probabilitiy of their joint occurrence is equal
#to the product of their individual probabilities.
