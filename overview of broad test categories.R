# UNPAIRED, INDEPENDENT GROUPS
# Is there a difference between groups that are unpaired - there is
# no possibility of the values in one data set being related to
# or influenced by values in the other data sets

# Numerical/quantitative data
# 1. does the data  follow the parameters of a normal/guassian curve/distribution?
#    YES: use parametric tests:
#         Unpaired t-test
#         ANOVA
#    NO or UNSURE: use non-parametric tests
#         Mann-Whitney U test
#         Wilcoxon's rank sum test
#         Kruskall-Wallis H test/ANOVA
# 2. More than two groups?
#    will have a a first test that, if significant, leads to a post-hoc test
#    Parametric post-hoc: 
#         Tukey's honestly significant diff test
#         Neuman-Keuls test
#         Bonferroni's test
#         Dunnette's test
#         Scheffe's test
#    Non-parametric post-hoc:
#         Dunn's test
#

# Categorical/qualitative data
#
# 1. Two groups?
#    Chi-square
#    Fisher's exact
# 2. More than 2 groups?
#    Chi-square test
